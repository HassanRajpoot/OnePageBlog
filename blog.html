        <p>COVID-19 has brought truly unprecedented times that no one saw coming. Seemingly overnight, the world as we knew it, changed! As the coronavirus started to jump borders and spread across the continents, many who were traveling abroad quickly scrambled to return home to family members and loved ones… while others were stranded, having to remain sequestered on quarantined cruise ships.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Amid the fear, uncertainty, and rapidly changing information, there are many inspiring stories of everyday heroes who have restored faith in humanity! Arising out of the chaos and confusion, “everyday people” have abundantly given out of the kindness of their hearts, and have even given their lives!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Inspiring Stories</h3>
        <p>As is often the case in a crisis, this coronavirus pandemic has revealed the true character of many people. Though there are plenty of negative and discouraging stories, there are also countless inspiring stories that have surfaced over the last few weeks of people doing what they can to help others including neighbors and friends, as well as complete strangers.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Not all heroes wear capes!</h3>
        <br>
        <p>One story that trended over social media is about Suzanne Hoylaerts, a Belgian woman 90 years of age. She offered her respirator to another patient saying, “I don’t want the artificial respirator, save it for younger patients. I had a beautiful life. Don’t cry, you did everything you could for me.”
    
            Age, wealth, race, religion, politics, and all the other things that make us who we are as individuals seem to matter a little less, and the fact that we are all human and in this world together, comes to matter more.</p>
